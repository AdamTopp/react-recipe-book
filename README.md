# Project: Recipe Book

It's build to store and manage user's recipes. Recipes consist of:

    - Name
    - Category
    - Price
    - Portions
    - List of ingredients
    - Desciption


Recipes can be filtered by:

    - setting their maximum price
    - setting their minimum price
    - searching a recipe that contains an ingredient
    

The menu to the right of the displayed recipes is used to create and choose
categories of recipes that we want to display.

If the recipe changes we can edit its' information by clicking the pen icon
on an expanded recipe (to expand a recipe just click onit)
